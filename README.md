# old-gre-data

This repo contains datasets related to the locations of Gardens of the Roman Empire.  This data comes from some the following sources:

* Point data for locations that could be matched to Pleiades locations, later verified by students (2016):

The roman_gardens_cleaned files (csv and gpkg) are a cleaned-up version of the Carto table, with extraneous fields removed, and Pleiades IDs added where possible.  Note that after the initial list of garden location names were geocoded to Pleiades points, the point locations may have been moved in many cases to match satellite imagery.  In some cases, the original Pleidades match may not have been correct, so each Pleaides place ID should be checked before linking to a particular garden.

* Point and polygen data for locations in Rome, digitized by students (2018):
